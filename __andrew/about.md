    I'm in my second year pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo.
    Prior to this year, I haven't worked with an operating system other than Windows. In my summer term where I learned 
    the Bash command line through UWaterloo's CS 246 course. My roommate introduced me to Arch Linux and the art of ricing, 
    and after binging Luke Smith videos I decided to migrate over to Linux. I'm currently dual booting Arch with windows on 
    my desktop using different SSD's as boot drives.
