    Hello there! I am a computer science undergraduate student experimenting with Arch Linux. 
    In this site, I'll be talking about my experiences with the installation and configuration of Arch, as well as
    all of the applicable knowledge I've learned while playing around with Linux.

about_me_txt: |-
    I'm in my second year pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo.
    Prior to this year, I haven't worked with an operating system other than Windows. In my summer term where I learned 
    the Bash command line through UWaterloo's CS 246 course. My roommate introduced me to Arch Linux and the art of ricing, 
    and after binging Luke Smith videos I decided to migrate over to Linux. I'm currently dual booting Arch with windows on 
    my desktop using different SSD's as boot drives.
